- 👋 Hi, I’m @GuilhermeAlecrim7K
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things so that I can decide what path I'm going to take in my Programming Career. I started my graduation in IT Systems in Feb, 2021 and it's
      been a wonderful journey. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Programming Logic, C++, Python and Github, among other things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anywhere I might have something to add.
